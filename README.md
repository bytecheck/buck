An opinionated rabbitmq client wrapper for `rabbit` library.

**Please note** that this project is most likely not for you since it's built with very specific requirements. It is also in active development and could break at any time. Use at your own risk.

### Why

While `rabbit` is a nice abstractions around `ampq`, it still verbose enough for us to build this.
